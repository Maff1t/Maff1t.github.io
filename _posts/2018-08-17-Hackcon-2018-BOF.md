  - CTF NAME: [Hackcon 2018](https://hackcon.in/)
  - Category: PWN
  - Binary: [vuln](http://ring0ot.github.io/binary/hackcon2018-vuln)
  - Difficulty: Easy

This challenge was the easiest, of the pwn challenges in the [Hackcon CTF 2018](https://hackcon.in/).

Let's open the binary and it says:

```
  Welcome, You know what to do. So go get the flag.

Hello
>>>
```
Obviously, the vulnerability is a buffer overflow, as it's suggested from the challenge's name. Infact, if we look in the code, we can see a <b>gets</b> function, that don't control the lenght of the input, and put him into a limitated buffer.
