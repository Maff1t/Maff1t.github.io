This was a personal project started in 2012, simply to learn something about the potential
of the AutoIT scripting language and the connection between two computers.
I hope you don't judge me, I was young and silly

The result had been excellent, and the software continue running very well now, after 5 years.

Here there is a video in witch I demonstrate the potentiality of the software.

I just released the source to study purposes on my [github repo](http://github.com/Ring0ot), hoping someone find it useful.
