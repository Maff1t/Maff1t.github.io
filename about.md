<p>I'm Lorenzo Maffia (aka Maff1t), a cybersecurity enthusiast since I was thirteen, when I bought my first computer, and I've started searching for How to stole password, create virus and other stupid stuffs like those....
I'm studing computer engineering at University of Genoa (Italy) where I've found a lot of teammates to play CTFs competitions, in the <a class="link" href="https://zenhack.team">ZenHack Team</a>
</p>

<p>I'm also part of the <a class="link" href="https://csec.it/">CSecLab</a>, the computer security laboratory of the University of Genoa, with a lot of brilliant university professors and PhD students.</p>


<p>I think hacking is only a way of thinking. Thinking outsite of the box and being curious about everything.</p>
