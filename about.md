<p>I'm Lorenzo Maffia (aka Maff1t), a cybersecurity enthusiast since I was thirteen, when I bought my first computer, and I've started searching for How to stole password, create virus and other stupid stuffs like those....
I'm currently working as Malware Analyst for CommunicationValley Reply in Milan, while I'm finisching my computer engineering master at University of Genoa (Italy).  

During my free time, I enjoy playing CTFs competitions with <a class="link" href="https://zenhack.team">ZenHack Team</a>, write songs, and play football.

</p>

<p>I'm also part of the <a class="link" href="https://csec.it/">CSecLab</a>, the computer security laboratory of the University of Genoa, with a lot of brilliant university professors and PhD students.</p>


<p>I think hacking is only a way of thinking. Thinking outsite of the box and being curious about everything.</p>
